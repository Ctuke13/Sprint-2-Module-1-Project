<!-- Intro to HTML & CSS I

  Module Project Overview

    You will build a website to display the bio of your favorite programmer, artist, etc.

    In order to do this, you will create an `index.html` file and scaffold the document
    with the elements shared by all HTML documents:

    - doctype declaration
    - html element
    - head, containing a title and an optional style tag
    - body, containing the markup that renders to the screen

  Requirements

    Review this article: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

    Create an `index.html` file for your site, or use this same file.

    For your site, you will make use of at least the following semantic elements:

    - header (to contain the main heading of the site, and the nav)
    - nav (to contain some links to navigate to the different sections of this document)
    - section (each holding at least a heading and a paragraph)
    - aside (containing an img and a caption)
    - footer (containing a contact form)
    - form (containing at least two inputs with their labels)

    See an example of a finished site: https://bloominstituteoftechnology.github.io/img/anita-borg-bio-website.png

    The example above is quite simple, but you can make your site as fancy as you'd like. -->

            Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring
            name The Rock, is an American actor, film producer, and former
            professional wrestler. Widely regarded as one of the greatest
            professional wrestlers of all time, he was integral to the
            development and success of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now
            WWE) during the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late
            1990s and early 2000s. Johnson wrestled for the WWF for eight years
            prior to pursuing an acting career.

            In 1996, Johnson's father Rocky assisted in helping him secure a
            contract with the WWF. Johnson quickly rose to global prominence,
            aided by a gimmick he employed as a charismatic trash talker.
            Johnson left WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time
            performer until 2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in
            2019. A 10-time world champion, including the promotion's first of
            African-American descent, he is also a two-time Intercontinental
            Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble
            winner, and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion. Johnson headlined the
            most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view (WrestleMania
            XXVIII) and was featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's
            flagship television series (Raw and SmackDown).
